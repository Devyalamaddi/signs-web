# 👐 Learning Tool for Sinhala Sign Language Fingerspelling Alphabet

## Background

This project is a web-based version of [aawgit/signs](https://github.com/aawgit/signs), utilizing the same pose estimator. The key differences are that the web version employs JavaScript, while the desktop version is built using Python. The models are exported from the same Python project for pose classification.

Pose estimation and classification occur directly in the browser. Some cropped hand images are sent to a backend service to enhance the classifier's accuracy. Users have the option to enable or disable this feature from the UI.
